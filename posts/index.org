#+TITLE: Notes from Andreas Zweili

I'm a Linux enthusiast from Switzerland.
Currently I'm interested in NixOS, Emacs, Python and Metal music.
In my job I work a lot with Ansible and and some Nix.
At home Iâ€™m hosting various services on RaspberryPi's running NixOS.

This is a static site build with Emacs and Nix you can find the source on [[https://github.com/Nebucatnetzer/org-posts][GitHub]].
