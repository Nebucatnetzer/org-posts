* About Me

I'm a Linux enthusiast from Switzerland.
Currently, I'm interested in NixOS, Emacs, Python and Metal music.
In my job I work a lot with Ansible and some Nix.
At home, I'm hosting various services on RaspberryPi's running NixOS.

* About this site

This is a static site built with Emacs and Nix you can find the source on [[https://github.com/Nebucatnetzer/org-posts][GitHub]].
You can find my othe projects there as well, they are just mirrors however.
Due to very agressiv LLM crawlers I had to close public access to my private git forge and decided to let Microsoft pay the bill for that traffic.

If you find a dead link pointing to *git.2li.ch* you might be able to find an up-to-date version on [[https://github.com/Nebucatnetzer?tab=repositories][GitHub]].
